These are the revised plates for the Hackbolt. This includes a fastener tool delete for those who wish to not use/attach the fastener tool (can be used on the Hellfire too)
as well as an extended fastener tool holder for those who do (not recommended for use on the Hellfire).

Recommended print settings are the same as in the original documentation.


Have fun!
