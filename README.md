All new downloads of the Hackbolt include the revised plates. Only download the "revised plates" folder if you have already downloaded a previous 
version of the Hackbolt or intend to use them with the Hellfire.

UPDATE 4-17-2021:

- Revised mag well to now have tighter tolerances. Should eliminate the slight mag rotation that was occurring. Tested with Gen3 PMAGS. They still drop free. If yours don't, then take a file/sand paper to the front of the mag well interior.

- Switched over to a low shelf to accommodate more room for Skittles.
