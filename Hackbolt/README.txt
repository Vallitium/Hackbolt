So, you decided to actually read the README? Congratulations! You're doing better than most!

This is the Hackbolt by Vallitium. It is an amalgamation between the Hellfire by PotatoSociety and the U-Bolt Vanguard by IvanTheTroll. Full credit to those two. All I did was put them together.

Testing was done with eSun PLA+. While other filaments such as ABS, ASA and PETG should be fine, I have not personally tested them. Use at your own discretion.

ASSEMBLEY:

-Your first step is to clean up and assemble the U-Bolt portion of the lower. Follow this video: https://lbry.tv/@Ivan's_CAD_Streams:c/Assembly-Video:5

Exact U-Bolt Used: https://www.mcmaster.com/3201T49

Rear takedown pin: Refer to the renders folder for a basic look at what the rear takedown pin can look like - any .250 bolt will work, if you would like to have it be self-retaining, you 
can use a threaded one and put a nut on it.

You MUST drill out the pin holes to size - 0.250 for the takedown pin, 0.156 for the hammer/trigger pins, and 0.375 for the safety selector hole.

The grip screw hole MUST be tapped with a 1/4x28 tap to ensure it will hold strong for a long time.

If you need more information about the lower itself, you can take a look at the included original U-Bolt readme titled "ORIGINAL-U-BOLT-README.txt"

-After you have the U-bolt part of the lower completed, it is time to install the front pivot pin plates. 

Simply take the two plates and align them with the corresponding holes in the lower. Then insert the screws; gently tightening with the screw tool till snug, then give another ~1/4 turn. 
Even slightly over-tightening will easily strip the threads of the screws/endplate. Be careful. 

-Procede to install your LPK and upper as normal.




Always remember that the first rule of gun safety is to have fun! Good luck!
